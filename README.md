## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Throughout this project I learned that I'm slowly getting a better understanding about what styles work with what elements and how to link them properly with JS. I still struggle with making responsive layout, I feel I need to add more media queries and I'm also feeling like I'm not using the width element much, if at all. I'm not sure if that's going to cause problems in the future, but for now it's my current workflow

I think next time I'll be trying to make the entire project responsive and looking the best it can on all resolutions and layouts! 

### Continued development

I definitely want to refine my use of JavaScript, I feel like I can do so much more with the little understanding I have now. The next step for me is working with APIs, I have so many ideas I want to explore with the use of different APIs so I'm hoping that will be a challenge I can complete within a reasonable amount of time.

### Useful resources

- [Video Resourse for Hamburger Menus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFKBep95lb4) - This was the first time I've seen what it takes to make a hamburger menu and it's from this video that I realised it wasn't so hard.
